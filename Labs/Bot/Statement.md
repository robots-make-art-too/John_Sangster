# THIS IS MY ARTIST STATEMENT - MY "WHY"

The functionality of this bot is very simple and limited: to post a random emoji

This function was chosen for two main reasons:
- The relative simplicity of implementing it. This did not have to track online data, catalogue server info, or perform any other task which would require it to look outside of its own code. This also translated to lower development time (advantageous due to tight schedule for other work)
- The random nature of its function. As simple as this bot may be, I did not want it to do the same thing every time. In my view, it was both more interesting to use and more interesting to develop a bot which would change what it did when called. Having some variance and randomness was a high priority

To go slightly further in depth, emojis were chosen for this bot due to both their simplicity (simpler for and more recognizable to the user than having the bot post Shakespeare quotes or anything else more complex) and their small size, making them better suited for listing in code (for example, using Shakespeare quotes might require reading them from an external, online source, which would increase complexity).
