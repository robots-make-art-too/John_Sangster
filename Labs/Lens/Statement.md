# THIS IS MY ARTIST STATEMENT - MY "WHY"

This project is to convert most text on a page to Comic Sans. 

The reasoning for this artistically is mainly based on the fact that it is a relatively simple project, both technically and artistically. Artistically, it is simple because it only alters the way in which information is presented to the viewer, without altering any of the content or context of that information. However, there is also an artistic motivation behind this - altering how information is presented can alter its "feel" to the audience. Serious information (such as government websites) presented in a comical way (using Comic Sans) is, at least, an interesting and amusing change, and was one of the main artistic motivations behind why I chose this as the project.
