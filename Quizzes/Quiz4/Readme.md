# Quiz 4 - we came; we built; we interacted

This is the last `quiz`... you've made it through:

- Quiz 1: `setup and soundbeats`
	- do you remember your first template clone into robots?
  - what about your reaction to `how do I make an emotion with code`? 
  - or changing `just one thing`?

- Quiz 2: `classy robot family`
	- do you know where your `classy` children are?
	- what about their parents? 
	- do you remember how similar `OOP` is when we looked at `processing.py` vs `p5.js`?

- Quiz 3: `message in a bottle`
  - you are no longer limited to `one file - one location`!
  - smile! There will be a surprize sent to your `GPS` next week!
  - interacting digitally across space and time (in just a few lines..)

## Let's look back

Our notes from last class (_THE_ [`last class`](last-class.md)) might be helpful to reference while answering the `Quiz 4` questions.

Here we go! Just answer in this `readme.md` file - you can even do it online, remember? (grab a copy of the repo first though!).

### Week 01

1. setup
   - What is a repo and why do we use them?
2. version control
   - Why do we use version control? How did you manage making use of this? Be specific.
3. processing
   - Why is processing similar across _at least_ three languages (Java, Python, JavaScript)? What might be the point of this?

---

### Week 02

1. IDEs
   - What IDEs did you use over the last 3.5 months?
2. UI & UI Elements
   - Give me a specific example of where you considered UI in any of your course content submissions?
3. JSON
   - What _exactly_ is JSON? Decide how you want to answer this.
4. CLI & GUI
   - Give me at least 3 ways we used GitHub and explain the difference between local and remote copies of a repo.
5. debug
   - What magical number-letter combo helps us debug in the browser? (What is a cross-origin error?) How can I display console content?

---

### Week 03

1. Browsers, extensions
   - Interaction with the browser through extensions required at least 2 things. Tell me what you think they are. There is a correct answer, and I talked about it in a January video.
2. DOM, selectors, elements
   - How are these related? 
3. JavaScript OOP
   - Show me 2 specific ways you used an OOP style in your course content submissions. Where did I use OOP in my p5.js updates?

---

### Week 04

1. Python
   - Show me where you completed the `try these` instructions from [Feb 3](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/EECS_1720/tree/main/General-Content/Content_by_Week/Week04/Week04-live_code)
2. Describe and list common attributes of any object-oriented programming language.

---

### Week 05

1. Python OOP
   - Write a python class for a `classy robot` that has the following: a name, an age, and can start and stop dancing when you clap. You can do it in under 10 lines (it can be pseudo-code like).
2. APIs
   - What API did you connect with in Lab 2? Briefly explain how you integrated interactivity within your code. 

---

### Week 06

1. server-client
   - Give me an example of an interaction done `client-side` and an interaction done `server-side`.
2. local hosting
   - what is the difference between dragging an index.html file into your browser and opening an index.html file using localhost? Do you remember the number equivalent to localhost? 

---

### Week 07

1. GitHub pages
   - What is a `deployment` in this context? What is a branch and why are they used for contributing to repos? 
2. Augmented Reality
   - What makes AR possible? What is needed in a code context?

---

### Week 08

1. aesthetics
   - Give me a specific example of where you considered aesthetic design in any of your course content?
2. APIs for extending integration
   - Identify where in _your_ code, for Quiz 1, Quiz 2, Quiz 3, Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3 that either you used an API or where you _could_ integrate an API (it could be that we added API access in the lecture example and you used the same - still identify this).

---

### Week 09

1. OOP elements & interactive JavaScript
   - How did we interact with webpage elements using code?
2. integrating multi-code & external content
   - What kind of event-based interactions are possible in web-based applications? 

---

### Week 10

1. Levels of location - local to geo
   - How did we instantiate multiple geo-locations and dynamic object loading in our AR code?
2. app hosting
   - What is important about constructing an app? How does this relate to its `environment`?

---

### Week 11

1. interaction along the virtuality-reality continuum
   - Why are `id`'s important for interaction?
2. Tell me about 2 WEB-APIs and how you could integrate them into any of your course content submissions? Give me a line or two of code.

---

### Week 12

1. tracking
   - Briefly describe how the complexity changes between image, facial, and hand, tracking? 
2. OOP, ECS, DOM
   - What are these acronyms? How are they related?
3. How do you register a component in A-Frame, and show me how to relate this component to data flow, API, and useage. 

---

## That's all!
